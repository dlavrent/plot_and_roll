Thanks for visiting!

I am a grad student studying the behavior of fruit flies by day (you can see more of my work at my personal site: [dlavrent.com](https://dlavrent.com)). I made Plot and Roll as a space to organize my side projects on my favorite sport.

Stay tuned for more (interactive) basketball visualizations and efforts to do some statistical modelling.

If you have any feedback, questions, or are just interested in chatting, I'm happy to connect on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/plotandroll) or via [email](mailto:pnr@plotandroll.com)!
